.PP
GLFW could not find support for the requested client API on the system\&. GLFW could not find support for the requested client API on the system\&. If emitted by functions other than \fBglfwCreateWindow\fP, no supported client API was found\&.
.PP
\fBAnalysis\fP
.RS 4
The installed graphics driver does not support the requested client API, or does not support it via the chosen context creation backend\&. Below are a few examples\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\fP
.RS 4
Some pre-installed Windows graphics drivers do not support OpenGL\&. AMD only supports OpenGL ES via EGL, while Nvidia and Intel only supports it via a WGL or GLX extension\&. OS X does not provide OpenGL ES at all\&. The Mesa EGL, OpenGL and OpenGL ES libraries do not interface with the Nvidia binary driver\&.

.SS "#define GLFW_FORMAT_UNAVAILABLE   0x00010009"

.PP
The requested format is not supported or available\&. If emitted during window creation, the requested pixel format is not supported\&.
.PP
If emitted when querying the clipboard, the contents of the clipboard could not be converted to the requested format\&.
.PP
\fBAnalysis\fP
.RS 4
If emitted during window creation, one or more \fBhard constraints\fP did not match any of the available pixel formats\&. If your application is sufficiently flexible, downgrade your requirements and try again\&. Otherwise, inform the user that their machine does not match your requirements\&.

.SS "#define GLFW_INVALID_ENUM   0x00010003"

.PP
One of the arguments to the function was an invalid enum value\&. One of the arguments to the function was an invalid enum value, for example requesting \fBGLFW_RED_BITS\fP with \fBglfwGetWindowAttrib\fP\&.

.SS "#define GLFW_INVALID_VALUE   0x00010004"

.PP
One of the arguments to the function was an invalid value\&. One of the arguments to the function was an invalid value, for example requesting a non-existent OpenGL or OpenGL ES version like 2\&.7\&.
.PP
Requesting a valid but unavailable OpenGL or OpenGL ES version will instead result in a \fBGLFW_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE\fP error\&.

.PP
No context is current for this thread\&. This occurs if a GLFW function was called that needs and operates on the current OpenGL or OpenGL ES context but no context is current on the calling thread\&. One such function is \fBglfwSwapInterval\fP\&.
.PP
\fBAnalysis\fP

Application programmer error\&. Ensure a context is current before calling functions that require a current context\&.

GLFW has not been initialized\&. This occurs if a GLFW function was called that may not be called unless the library is \fBinitialized\fP\&.

Application programmer error\&. Initialize GLFW before calling any function that requires initialization\&.

The requested OpenGL or OpenGL ES version is not available\&. The requested OpenGL or OpenGL ES version (including any requested context or framebuffer hints) is not available on this machine\&.

.RS 4
Future invalid OpenGL and OpenGL ES versions, for example OpenGL 4\&.8 if 5\&.0 comes out before the 4\&.x series gets that far, also fail with this error and not \fBGLFW_INVALID_VALUE\fP, because GLFW cannot know what future versions will exist\&.
