.PP
If the mode is \fCGLFW_CURSOR\fP, the value must be one of the following cursor modes:

\fCGLFW_CURSOR_NORMAL\fP makes the cursor visible and behaving normally\&.

If the mode is \fCGLFW_STICKY_KEYS\fP, the value must be either \fCGL_TRUE\fP to enable sticky keys, or \fCGL_FALSE\fP to disable it\&.
